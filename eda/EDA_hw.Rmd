# Question 1

Make a ggplot showing the number of pseudogenes over the organism
`type`. You can use `geom_point`. Sort the `orgs` table to show just
the rows for the three organisms with the most pseudogenes.

# Question 2

Make a nice looking table using `kable`, which shows the ratio of
transcripts (`tx`) to the number of genes (just add `coding` and
`noncoding` genes), averaged for each organism `type`.

# Question 3

Using similar code as in the brain RNA Rmarkdown file, make a PCA
plot for the samples in the following three regions, {Cortex,
Hippocampus, and Hypothalamus} and color the samples by region.
You can have one large chunk where you read in and pre-process the
data using the same code from the Rmarkdown in class (you don't need
to break this code into smaller chunks).
